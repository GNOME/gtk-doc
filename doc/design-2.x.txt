= gtk-doc-2.X =
This documents purpose is to collect what needs to be changed for a potential
gtk-doc-2.X.

== name ==
Its not about Gtk. Its about C APIs with GObject support.
g-doc, gapi-doc, gnome-api-doc, ...

== remove and deprecate =
- tree_index and object_index are still named *.sgml
- in the makefiles
  sgml-build.stamp -> db-build.stamp
  sgml.stamp -> db.stamp

== design fixes ==
=== proper xml-id namesspaces ===
We need proper xml-id namesspaces for document structure and symbols to avoid
clashes e.g. between GtkWidget as a section and as a struct. Normal symbols
should only be mangled to be a valid xml-id. Document structure ids should
contain a prefix.

These are the rules regarding id-attributes:

http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id:
"ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by
 any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons
 (":"), and periods (".")."

http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/#id-avn
"Attributes of type ID are subject to additional normalization rules: removing
 leading and trailing space characters and replacing sequences of spaces with a
 single space."

http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#NT-Name
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Name

So we could easily use "DOC:" as a prefix for document structure ids.
In 1.x we add :CAPS as a suffix to avoid clashes between lower and uppercase
constructs. XML-IDs are not case insensitive, so we don't need that.

If the ID contain a ':' xml processors belive it is using a namespace.

=== less files to maintain ===
- one needs to maintain $module-docs.xml
- in most cases $module-sections.txt need manual maintenance
  - we could have a "Section:" tag for non-section comments to add them to a non
    default section
  - we could have a "Private_Symbols:" tag in section to list symbols that
    should be in private subsection
- the $module.types file need manual maintenance if one need special includes
  - can we make the scanner smarter?

=== srcdir != builddir builds ===

=== build dependencies ===

=== report files ===
- instead of having -{undocumented,undeclared,unused}.txt have just one file
- have sections in there for each type
- have a summary at the top
- have an option to disable generating the file
  (or an option to specifically name it)

=== markup ===
