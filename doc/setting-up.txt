How to Set Up an Application or Library to use GTK-Doc
======================================================

This assumes that you are using autoconf & automake to build your package.


1. Insert the code from examples/configure.in into your configure.in.
   (somewhere before the call to AC_OUTPUT.)

2. Create a directory in which you want the docs to be built,
   e.g. 'myproject/docs/reference'.

3. Copy examples/Makefile.am to this directory and edit the variables at
   the top of the file.

4. Add the new Makefile to your configure.in's AC_OUTPUT call, and make sure
   all the SUBDIRS variables are set properly so the docs directory is built.

5. If your library or application includes GtkObjects/GObjects, and you want
   their signals, arguments/parameters and position in the hierarchy to be
   documented:

   Create a MODULE.types file in the docs directory, e.g. "myproject.types".
   This should contain any '#include' directives needed to compile a program
   with your module, and a list of functions to initialize all of the widgets
   and objects in the library. For example, the gtk.types file starts like
   this:

	#include <gtk/gtk.h>

	gtk_accel_label_get_type
	gtk_adjustment_get_type
	gtk_alignment_get_type
	gtk_arrow_get_type


That's it! If you now build the application or library you should get a
complete set of documentation. (Note that due to make being awkward the build
may fail the first time, but if you run make again it should work.)


You can tweak the output in several ways:

 o modify the main SGML file to add introductory sections or to split the
   documentation into several chapters.

 o modify the MODULE-sections.txt file to rearrange the documentation into
   different sections or a different order (see sections-file.txt for info).

 o add a MODULE-overrides.txt to override particular declarations.
