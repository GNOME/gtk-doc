GTK+ DocBook Documentation Generator
====================================

GTK-Doc is used to document C code. It is typically used to document the public
API of libraries, such as the GTK+ and GNOME libraries, but it can also be
used to document application code.

Note that GTK-Doc wasn't originally intended to be a general-purpose
documentation tool, so it can be a bit awkward to setup and use.
For a more polished general-purpose documentation tool you may want to look
at Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). However GTK-Doc has some special code
to document the signals and properties of GTK+ widgets and GObject classes
which other tools may not have.

From your source code comments GTK-Doc generates a Docbook XML document, which
is then transformed into HTML and/or PDF.
The generated HTML documentation can be browsed in an ordinary web browser or
by using the special Devhelp API browser
(see http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Devhelp).

Please use DoxBook XML instead of DocBook SGML - support for the later will be
dropped.

Requirements
============

Python 2.7, 3.x - the secondary scripts are written in Python
    http:///www.python.org

For XML output (recommended):

The DocBook XML DTD.
    http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/

The DocBook XSL Stylesheets.
    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/

libxslt & libxml2 >= 2.3.6.
    http://xmlsoft.org/


Most distributions now have packages for all of these, so I would strongly
advise that you grab those.

See the documentation in the help/manual directory for more information. You can
read it e.g. with yelp file://$PWD/help/manual/C/gtk-doc-manual.xml
