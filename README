GTK-Doc - Documentation generator for C code
============================================

Introduction
------------

GTK-Doc is used to document C code. It is typically used to document the public
API of libraries, such as GLib-based libraries, but it can also be used to
document application code.

Note that GTK-Doc wasn't originally intended to be a general-purpose
documentation tool, so it can be a bit awkward to setup and use. For a more
general-purpose documentation tool you may want to look at
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/). However GTK-Doc has some special code to
document the signals and properties of GTK widgets and GObject classes which
other tools may not have.

From your source code comments GTK-Doc generates a DocBook XML document, which
is then transformed into HTML and/or PDF.

The generated HTML documentation can be browsed in an ordinary web browser or
by using the special
[Devhelp API browser](https://github.com/gdev-technology/devhelp).

Important message about the docbook-style-xsl dependency
--------------------------------------------------------

To generate the `api-index-*.html` files, you need to use docbook-style-xsl
version 1.79.1, not the latest version.

Requirements
------------

Python 3.x
    http:///www.python.org

Additional python modules:
    For the tests: unittest, parameterized
    For mkhtml2 (experimental): anytree, lxml and pygments
    For fixxref: pygments

For XML output (recommended):

The DocBook XML DTD.
    http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/

The DocBook XSL Stylesheets.
    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/

libxslt & libxml2 >= 2.3.6.
    http://xmlsoft.org/

For PDF output:

the dblatex tool.
    http://dblatex.sourceforge.net/

Most distributions now have packages for all of these, so I would strongly
advise that you grab those.

See the documentation in the help/manual/ directory for more information. You
can read it for example with yelp: `yelp help/manual/C/index.docbook`.

Building
--------

The [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system is used.
